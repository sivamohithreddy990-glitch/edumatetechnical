                <p class="long-text">Start with ONE core language—C or Python. Do not try to learn 100 tools. Focus on understanding how a computer thinks, how memory is used, and how loops work. This is the time to build your foundation. Aim for a CGPA of 8.5+ because elite companies use GPA as a primary filter. Work on your English communication; if you can't explain your code, nobody will hire you. Participate in one non-tech club to build teamwork skills.</p>

Start solving 2-3 problems on LeetCode every day. By the end of Sem 4, you should have solved 200+ problems. Also, take your first NPTEL course (DBMS or OS) to validate your technical expertise.

Semester 6 is when you apply for Summer Internships. Companies like Google (STEP) and Amazon (WoW) hire now.
